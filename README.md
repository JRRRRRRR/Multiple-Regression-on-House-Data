# Phase-2-Project
Multiple Regression on House Data
# Introduction
For this project, I'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset.
* A house buyer assigns me a task about the house in King County. He wants to buy a house in this area but doesn't have any ideas about the housing market. And he has some preferred features in his mind, he wants to have a predicted price so that he can prepare for that.
In this business problem, I will use King County House Sales dataset to analyze. Base on this situation, I am planning to give him an overview of the housing market and how the footage of the home(sqft_living) affects the price. At last, I will make a prediction of price with his prefer features using the model. Therefore, I divide this issue into three parts.
1. What features does he need to concern about?
    * Find the most related features with the price. 
2. How the footage of the home (sqft_living) affect the price?
    * Find the correlation between them and the regression model.
3. How much should he prepare for the dream house?
    * Find the prediction of price with the model.

# Technics
* Data collecting, Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, and Visualization are all in the Jupyter Notebook.
* A PowerPoint and pdf for presentation
* A 5 minutes recording to review
* https://youtu.be/dHvQY3RFP58

# Recommendation
* For buyers: When buying a house, we should more concern about the powerful grade ranking and house size including footage of the house, number of bathrooms, and so on because these features are most related to the house price
* For analysts: Transformation is a good thing to improve R-squared and reduce the condition number

# Future Work
* Interactions: Find some interactions on the model to see whether helpful to improve the R-square
* Kurtosis: Find some ways to reduce kurtosis to make the distribution more normal
* Detailed Prediction: Give a price prediction to the buyer based on his prefer features using the model
* More analyses: Try another business case such as helping a house seller
 
# Summary
From this project, I had the experience that applying multiple regression in our real world. It provided me a chance to review my knowledge and skills. I found my weakness and make a plan to improve those.
